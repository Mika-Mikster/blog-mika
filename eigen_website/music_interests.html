    <h1>My music likes</h1>
    <p>
      I love playing the piano, making music or just listening to music. <br>
      The radio is nearly always on were I am and if not then I plug in my headphones
      and listen to my playlists on Spotify :)
    </p>
    <p>
      Below is a list of some of the artists that I listen to but there is soooo much that I listen to,
      that it is difficult to put it in a list on this page. <br>
      It would possibly become a never-ending list :p
    <ul>
      <li>Babymetal,</li>
      <li>Pentatonix,</li>
      <li>Lindsey Stirling,</li>
      <li>Linkin Park,</li>
      <li>Michael Jackson,</li>
      <li>Disney music,</li>
      <li>Movie soundtracks,</li>
      <li>Phil Collins,</li>
      <li>Walk Off the Earth</li>
    </ul>
