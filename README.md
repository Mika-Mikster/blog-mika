# blog-mika
The official start of my own blog/website to show my programming skills and share my knowledge (eventually).

I wanted to upgrade my PHP skills by developing a blog.
Due credits should be given to David Carr (daveismyname), by writing a very good explanation of how to build a blog.
The biggest part of my blog code is a copy of his demo and I builded further on that.

this readme file will be updated with a better explanation of all the written code
