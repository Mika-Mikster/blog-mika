    <h1>Hello out there</h1>
    <section id="introduction">
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Mika. <br>
        I'm just your average type girl from a small, but maybe influential country. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not gonna post a picture of myself here (privacy etcetera)
        but I sorta look like Nell Jones from
        <a href="http://www.cbs.com/shows/ncis_los_angeles/cast/72038/">NCIS LA.</a>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="where_to_find_me">
      <p>
        I guess if you would really want to know what I look like in real life,
        you could probably google my name <em>Mika</em> and find some pictures of the real me
        (or maybe not :p).
      </p>
      <p>
        I could also just make it really easy for your guys to actually find me by placing links to a few of
        my social media accounts in the sidebar.<br>
        Which I did do, but do you really think those are my real accounts? O:) <br>
        Isn't it quite the coincidence that they all have pictures of Nell Jones?
      </p>

    <section id="preview_interests">
    <p>
      A few of the things I like are:

        <li>The culture</li>
        <li>Food</li>
        <li>People</li>
        <li>And language</li>

      <li>Playing the piano</li>
      <li>Languages</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
    <section id="known_languages">
      <p>
        Here is the list of languages that I already know: (1=best, 10=worst etc.)
        <ol>
          <li>Dutch</li>
          <li>English</li>

          <li>French</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish I knew more languages than I do now, but <q cite="Aussies">no worries mate</q>,
        I will get there for sure :)
      </p>

      <p>
        And that's what I plan to do, to <em>never</em> stop learning.
